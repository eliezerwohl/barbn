    <h1>First Visit</h1>
    <p>On your first visit to my office I will introduce myself to you, show you the office, and ask for your first visit forms. You may find these forms below. It would be very helpful if you would kindly print them out, complete them, and bring them with you to your first visit.</p>
    <p>After that I will ask you questions about yourself, inquire as to what you would like to get out of therapy, and ask about your past. This will help me to determine whether or not psychotherapy is appropriate for you, and, if so, whether I am the appropriate therapist for you. I will always refer you to where you may obtain the services you need if I feel this type of therapy is not right for you. Then it is your turn to ask questions of me!</p>
    <p>At this point we will review the financial arrangements and I will take your information if you have insurance.</p>
    <p>Following this, I like to go over my privacy and confidentiality policies.</p>
    <p>Then, if we feel we are a good match we can schedule your next appointment(s).</p>
