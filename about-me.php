    <p>I am a bilingual licensed clinical social worker with a private practice in North Brunswick, NJ, who has been in the caring and helping professions in the healthcare arena since 1993. Therapy sessions are conducted in English and Spanish. I specialize in working with individuals who have experienced trauma. My focus in this area is twofold: childhood sexual abuse (victims and nonoffending parents) and eating/weight problems. Just as importantly, I also work with individuals who are experiencing depression, anxiety, grief and loss, family issues, stage of life issues, and sexuality issues.</p>
    <p>I work with individuals of all ages and stages of life, including children from 6 to 12 years old, preteens from 11 to 13 years old, adolescents/teenagers from 14 to 19 years old, adults 20 years old and older, and older adults 65 and older. My practice is in a central area, close to public transportation.</p>
